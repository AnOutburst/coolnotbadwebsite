# coolnotbadwebsite
Not a bad website at all, very cool actually. If you say it is bad i will yell at you.

All jokes aside this is pretty much just mess around with git functionality, as well as attempt to make a geocities esque shitty website. I would reccomend you not take this as an actual reflection on my programming skill nor my psyche, although it may be closer to those than I would like to admit.
